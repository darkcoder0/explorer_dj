# Setting up MySQL with Django

This guide will walk you through setting up MySQL as your database for a Django project.

## Prerequisites

- Python installed on your system
- Django installed in your project (`pip install django`)
- MySQL server installed and running
- MySQL client (`mysqlclient`) installed (`pip install mysqlclient`)

## Step 1: Install MySQL Server

Ensure that MySQL server is installed on your system. You can download it from the [official MySQL website](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/).
